Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometer’s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.
## Publishing Task
- Add the code to the Git repository.
- Update the repository’s README with:
- Task Requirements and/or Description
- Photos of your setup
- A link to a video showcasing functionality (YouTube is recommended,but any accessible platform is acceptable).  Ensure the video is in thecorrect orientation.
